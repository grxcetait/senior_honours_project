  abstract = {We present a detection of correlated clustering between MeerKAT radio intensity maps and galaxies from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey. We find a \$7.7{$\sigma\$$} detection of the cross-correlation power spectrum, the amplitude of which is proportional to the product of the HI density fraction (\${\textohm}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\}\$), HI bias (\$b\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\}\$) and the cross-correlation coefficient (\$r\$). We therefore obtain the constraint \${\textohm}\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\} b\_\{{\textbackslash}rm HI\} r{\textbackslash},\{=\}{\textbackslash},[0.86{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}pm\}{\textbackslash},0.10{\textbackslash},(\{{\textbackslash}rm stat\}){\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}pm\}{\textbackslash},0.12{\textbackslash},(\{{\textbackslash}rm sys\})]{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}times\}{\textbackslash},10{\textasciicircum}\{-3\}\$, at an effective scale of \$k\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\}{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}sim\}{\textbackslash},0.13{\textbackslash},h{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm Mpc\}{\textasciicircum}\{-1\}\$. The intensity maps were obtained from a pilot survey with the MeerKAT telescope, a 64-dish pathfinder array to the SKA Observatory (SKAO). The data were collected from 10.5 hours of observations using MeerKAT's L-band receivers over six nights covering the 11hr field of WiggleZ, in the frequency range \$1015-973{\textbackslash},\{{\textbackslash}rm MHz\}\$ (0.400\${\textbackslash},\{{$<$}\}{\textbackslash},z{\textbackslash},\{{$<$}\}{\textbackslash},\$0.459 in redshift). This detection is the first practical demonstration of the multi-dish auto-correlation intensity mapping technique for cosmology. This marks an important milestone in the roadmap for the cosmology science case with the full SKAO.},

  abstract = {The detection of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has been one of the major breakthroughs in modern cosmology. Several cosmological probes (CMB, SNe Ia, BAO) have been studied in depth to better understand the nature of the mechanism driving this acceleration, and they are being currently pushed to their limits, obtaining remarkable constraints that allowed us to shape the standard cosmological model. In parallel to that, however, the percent precision achieved has recently revealed apparent tensions between measurements obtained from different methods. These are either indicating some unaccounted systematic effects, or are pointing toward new physics. Following the development of CMB, SNe, and BAO cosmology, it is critical to extend our selection of cosmological probes. Novel probes can be exploited to validate results, control or mitigate systematic effects, and, most importantly, to increase the accuracy and robustness of our results. This review is meant to provide a state-of-art benchmark of the latest advances in emerging beyond-standard cosmological probes. We present how several different methods can become a key resource for observational cosmology. In particular, we review cosmic chronometers, quasars, gamma-ray bursts, standard sirens, lensing time-delay with galaxies and clusters, cosmic voids, neutral hydrogen intensity mapping, surface brightness fluctuations, stellar ages of the oldest objects, secular redshift drift, and clustering of standard candles. The review describes the method, systematics, and results of each probe in a homogeneous way, giving the reader a clear picture of the available innovative methods that have been introduced in recent years and how to apply them. The review also discusses the potential synergies and complementarities between the various probes, exploring how they will contribute to the future of modern cosmology.},

  abstract = {We apply for the first time Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) as a foreground removal technique in the context of single-dish, low redshift HI intensity mapping, and present an open-source Python toolkit for doing so. We use MeerKAT and SKA1-MID-like simulations of 21cm foregrounds (including polarisation leakage), HI cosmological signal and instrumental noise. We find that it is possible to use GPR as a foreground removal technique in this context, and that it is better suited in some cases to recover the HI power spectrum than Principal Component Analysis (PCA), especially on small scales. GPR is especially good at recovering the radial power spectrum, outperforming PCA when considering the full bandwidth of our data. Both methods are worse at recovering the transverse power spectrum, since they rely on frequency-only covariance information. When halving our data along frequency, we find that GPR performs better in the low frequency range, where foregrounds are brighter. It performs worse than PCA when frequency channels are missing, to emulate RFI flagging. We conclude that GPR is an excellent foreground removal option for the case of single-dish, low redshift HI intensity mapping in the absence of missing frequency channels. Our Python toolkit gpr4im and the data used in this analysis are publicly available on GitHub.},
